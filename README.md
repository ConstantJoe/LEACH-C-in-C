# LEACH-C-in-C
An implementation of the LEACH-C algorithm, written in C. This is a modified version of the LEACH-C repo to enable centralised coordination of the network. The optimal cluster configuration is generated using the simulated annealing algorithm.

This repo is currently work-in-progress.
